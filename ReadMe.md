The Wishy Washy Cat

Synopsis
Fast forward to the year 2948, all the humans have died. Only cats have resisted the environmental and nuclear devastation inflicted on the earth in tragic centuries that have passed. Of course, if any species were to be resilient enough to preserve their lineage after such assaults, it would be the felines. Our anti-hero, Mr. Furocious, hated by all, just wants to be understood.
